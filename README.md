Data Structures Lab â€“ MIT Manipal

This repository contains C programs implemented as part of the Data Structures Laboratory (DS-Lab) coursework. Each program demonstrates fundamental data structures and their operations, ranging from arrays and linked lists to stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Features

Clean and simple C implementations.

Covers all major DS concepts taught in lab.

Menu-driven programs where applicable.

Beginner-friendly code with comments.
